                    Mysore Palace
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This palace is regarded as one of the largest and magnificent palaces in India, located in Southern Mysore. It was the official residence that belonged to the Wodeyar Dynasty, the ruler of Mysore (1399-1950). This palace has an extensive history of its
                    construction. Originally, it was constructed as a wooden structure that was once stuck by lighting and reconstructed by Kantirava Narasa Raja Wodeyar. Once again, in 1793, Tipu Sultan demolished it and built a new one. And after his death, Krishanaraja Wodeyar 
                    III redesigned it in the Hindu architectural style. In 1897 this palace was destroyed by fire again and built under British rule by Henry Irwin in Indo-Saracenic style and completed in 1912. It also consists of a touch of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic 
                    architectural styles. The palace is a 3-storied building with 145 feet, 5-storied tower.
