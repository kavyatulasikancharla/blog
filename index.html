                <h3>Mysore Palace</h3>
                <p>
                    This palace is regarded as one of the largest and most magnificent palaces in India, located in Southern Mysore. It was the official residence of the Wodeyar Dynasty, the rulers of Mysore (1399-1950). Originally, it was constructed as a wooden structure that was once struck by lightning and reconstructed by Kantirava Narasa Raja Wodeyar. In 1793, Tipu Sultan demolished it and built a new one. After his death, Krishnaraja Wodeyar III redesigned it in the Hindu architectural style. In 1897, this palace was destroyed by fire again and rebuilt under British rule by Henry Irwin in Indo-Saracenic style, completed in 1912. It also consists of elements from Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic architectural styles. The palace is a three-storied building with a 145-foot, five-storied tower.

                <p>
                    Located in Central India, Sanchi Stupa is considered the greatest and earliest stupa, serving as an architectural prototype. Ashoka built it in the 3rd century BCE. Sanchi Stupa is dedicated to Buddhism, and its walls feature many inscriptions. It is designed as a hemispherical brick structure over the relics of Buddha. The Sanchi Stupa complex contains several other stupas and pillars, built during the Mauryan period.
